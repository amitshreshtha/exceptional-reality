 <p>Chances are, when you think about investing in real estate the first thing that comes to mind is your home. For many people, their home is the single largest investment they will ever make. But have you ever stopped to consider that once you purchase a home it becomes part of your overall portfolio of investments? In fact, it's one of the most important parts of your portfolio because it serves a dual role as not only an investment but also a centerpiece to your daily life.</p>
